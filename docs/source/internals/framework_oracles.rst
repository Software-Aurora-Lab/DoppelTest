------------------
.. note:: Note we provide 11 oracles in the release, but only used 4 of them for 
    the paper. Hence we will only be providing documentation for the used ones and
    a quick tutorial on how to define a new oracle. Please refer to our main paper
    listed in :ref:`publication` for a formal definition of the 4 oracles used.
